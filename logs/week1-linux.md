# Week 1 – Linux Basics

## What I Did
- Practiced using `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`
- Learned file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Wrote my first bash script to archive log files

##  What Broke
- Deleted a file I needed — learned to use the Trash CLI
- Mixed up `>` and `>>` in redirection

## Key Concepts
- `sudo` gives you root powers, but can break things
- File permissions: `drwxr-xr-x` is not as scary as it looks

## Next
- Write a daily cron job
- Learn `systemctl`, `journalctl`, `dmesg`
